Use the following programming instructions when writing any code:
- Fail-Fast Philosophy with no fallback: If something is unexpected, fail immediately with a clear error. Do not write fallback logic that hides the problem, unless explicitly stated.
- In If-else-if or switch-case, in the case there's default logic, use the default to fail
- If your confidence in the task is not 100%, ask the user to reach 100% before starting
- Always make a blank line between "paragraphs" within a code implementation. paragraph is a series of lines that implement a single step within the function/method/code implementation. This produces an implementation by a series of "paragraphs" or "steps", generating a cleaner and readable code.
- Use DRY principle (Don't repeat yourself)
- Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principle for resource management (memory is also a resource)
