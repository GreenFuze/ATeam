# Implementation Notes & Questions

## Architecture Understanding ✅

### Core Shift
- **From**: Web-based multi-agent system (FastAPI + WebSockets)
- **To**: CLI-based multi-agent system (TUI/REPL + Redis MCP)

### Key Components
1. **Console** (`ateam console`): Central TUI with F1 palette, TAB autocomplete
2. **Agent** (`ateam agent`): Autonomous worker with local REPL, MCP server
3. **MCP Transport**: Redis pub/sub for events, RPC for commands
4. **Config Discovery**: `.ateam` directory stack with merge precedence

### Design Principles
- **Explicit over implicit**: No auto-approve paths
- **Fail-fast**: Immediate failure with clear errors
- **Single-instance locks**: Prevent duplicate agents
- **Scoped resources**: Agent/project/user KB scopes
- **Ownership model**: One console writer per agent

## Implementation Progress

### Phase 0 — Repository bootstrap & packaging ✅
- Created `ateam/` package structure.
- Configured `pyproject.toml` with Flit and dependencies.

- Implemented `AgentIdentity` for `project/agent` name computation.
- Created and ran unit tests for config discovery, merging, and identity.

### Phase 2 — Redis MCP transport & registry ✅
- Implemented `RedisTransport` for pub/sub and RPC communication.
- Implemented `MCPServer` for agent-side RPC handling.
- Implemented `MCPClient` for console-side RPC calls.
- Implemented `MCPRegistryClient` for agent discovery and monitoring.
- Implemented `HeartbeatService` for TTL-based health monitoring.
- Implemented `OwnershipManager` for console-agent ownership.
- Created data contracts and types for MCP communication.
- Created and ran unit tests for MCP transport system.

### Phase 3 — Agent runtime skeleton ✅
- Implemented `AgentApp` with full bootstrap process (discovery → identity → lock → MCP server → registry → heartbeat → REPL).
- Implemented `PromptQueue` with JSONL storage and append/peek/pop operations.
- Implemented `HistoryStore` with JSONL storage and summarization.
- Implemented `PromptLayer` with base + overlay system and live reload.
- Implemented `AgentREPL` with basic command handling (status, enqueue, sys, reload, kb, quit).
- Implemented `AgentCompleter` with TAB autocomplete for commands and paths.
- Bound MCP tools: status, input, interrupt, cancel, prompt.set, prompt.reload.
- Created comprehensive unit tests for all agent components.
- All tests passing and modules importing correctly.

### Phase 4 — Console attach/detach & non-blocking UI ✅
- Implemented `ConsoleApp` with event loop and Redis connection management.
- Implemented `ConsoleUI` with basic TTY interface and notification system.
- Implemented `ConsoleCompleter` with command, agent ID, and path completion.
- Implemented `CommandRouter` with handlers for all console commands (/ps, /attach, /detach, /input, /status, /help, /quit, /ctx, /sys, /reloadsysprompt, /kb, /ui).
- Implemented `AgentSession` with MCP client connection and tail subscription.
- Added ownership management (read-only for now, will be enhanced later).
- Created comprehensive unit tests for all console components.
- All components importing and functioning correctly.

### Phase 5 — LLM integration & memory ✅
- Implemented `MemoryManager` with context token tracking and summarization policy.
- Created `LLMProvider` abstract base class with streaming and non-streaming interfaces.
- Implemented `EchoProvider` for testing with configurable delays and token estimation.
- Implemented `TaskRunner` with LLM integration, tool interception, and streaming token output.
- Integrated memory management into `AgentApp` with configurable context limits and thresholds.
- Added queue processing with automatic task execution and history management.
- Enhanced interrupt and cancel handlers to work with the task runner.
- Created comprehensive unit tests for all Phase 5 components.
- All components importing and functioning correctly.

## Next Steps

**Phase 6** ✅ **COMPLETE** - **KB scopes & selective copy**:
- ✅ Port KB logic to `agent/kb_adapter.py` + `ateam/kb/`
- ✅ Add MCP tools `kb.ingest`, `kb.copy_from`
- ✅ Implement Console commands `/kb add`, `/kb search`, `/kb copy-from` with explicit scope
- ✅ De-dupe by content hash

**Phase 7** ✅ **COMPLETE** - **Comprehensive testing & integration**:
- ✅ Fix major test failures (104/114 tests passing)
- ✅ Redis connection issues resolved
- ✅ Console UI and completer tests passing
- ✅ Config tests passing
- ✅ Phase 6 KB tests passing
- ✅ All async/await mocking issues fixed
- ✅ All 114 tests now passing (100% success rate)

**Phase 8** ✅ **COMPLETE** - **System prompts & overlays**:
- ✅ Add Console commands: `# <text>`, `/sys show`, `/sys edit`, `/reloadsysprompt`
- ✅ Persist overlays and reapply on reload
- ✅ Render effective prompt with markers
- ✅ Add `prompt.get` RPC handler to agent
- ✅ Enhance AgentSession with system prompt methods
- ✅ Update console completer with overlay suggestions
- ✅ Comprehensive tests (136 tests passing)

## Key Insights

1. **Testing Discipline**: Running all tests after each phase ensures no regressions and maintains code quality.
2. **Modular Design**: Each component is self-contained with clear interfaces, making testing and development easier.
3. **Fail-Fast Philosophy**: All error conditions are handled immediately with clear error messages.
4. **JSONL Persistence**: Using JSONL for queue and history provides durability and easy debugging.
5. **MCP Integration**: The Redis-based MCP transport provides clean separation between agents and console.

**Phase 11** ✅ **COMPLETE** - **Reliability, security, edge cases**:
- ✅ **Ownership Takeover Flow**: Implemented graceful takeover with `--takeover` flag and configurable grace timeout
- ✅ **Disconnected Agent Detection**: Enhanced heartbeat monitoring with `HeartbeatMonitor` class for detecting missed heartbeats
- ✅ **Graceful Agent Shutdown**: Proper signal handling, ownership lock release, and component cleanup sequence
- ✅ **Redis ACL/TLS Configuration**: Comprehensive security configuration with ACL authentication, TLS/SSL support, client certificates
- ✅ **Path Sandboxing**: Complete `PathSandbox` and `CommandSandbox` implementation for FS/OS tool security
- ✅ **Security Configuration**: Structured security configuration schema with path and command restrictions
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 25 new tests covering all reliability and security features

## Confidence Level: 100% ✅

Phase 11 is complete and thoroughly tested. All reliability and security features are fully implemented. The system now supports:

- **Graceful Takeover**: Console can take over agent ownership with configurable grace periods and notifications
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Automatic detection of disconnected agents via missed heartbeats with callback system
- **Signal Handling**: Proper SIGINT/SIGTERM handling for graceful agent shutdown with resource cleanup
- **Enhanced Redis Security**: Full ACL/TLS support with client certificates, connection pooling, and security validation
- **Path Sandboxing**: Comprehensive file system access control with allowed/denied paths, dangerous file detection
- **Command Sandboxing**: Command execution restrictions with shell command detection and working directory validation
- **Security Configuration**: Structured configuration system for all security controls with strict mode support
- **Robust Testing**: Extensive test coverage for all security and reliability features

The system is ready for Phase 12: History & summaries polish.

## Next Steps

**Phase 12** will focus on **History & summaries polish**:
- Implement summarization compaction strategy
- Reconstruct ctx from summaries + tail on agent restart
- `/clearhistory` destructive flow with typed confirmation
